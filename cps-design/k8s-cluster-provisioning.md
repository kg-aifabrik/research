# CPS — K8s Cluster Provisioning (First Capability)

Living design plan for the **Compute Provisioning Service (CPS)** first capability:
provision a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster for a tenant and (follow-up) hand back a
kubeconfig. Built up through design discussion; updated as decisions land.

> Scope of this capability: from a Tenant Management Service (TMS) request through
> a running, AiFabrik-managed K8s cluster on reserved site hardware. **Storage
> (Weka) and tenant kubeconfig delivery are deferred** (see Follow-ups).

## Executive summary

CPS is a **stateless Temporal orchestrator** exposing gRPC to its single client,
TMS. A provision request runs as one Temporal workflow (saga) that: reserves
hardware in NetBox via the Network Provisioning Service (NPS), creates a tenant
network (VRF/VLAN) via NPS→Apstra, provisions OS + builds K8s via the Rafay
Controller, and deploys the AiFabrik management/monitoring addon. NetBox is the
**System of Record (SoR)** for inventory and allocation; TMS/PGSQL owns the
business mapping tenant→cluster→assets (for billing). The call is **async**: the
API returns an operation handle and TMS polls for status.

## Actors & systems

All cloud components run in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

| Component | Where | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **TMS** (Tenant Management Service) | GCP / mgmt plane | CPS's client; owns tenant→cluster→assets mapping in PGSQL (billing). |
| **CPS** (Compute Provisioning Service) | GCP | Temporal orchestrator, gRPC API. **Stateless** beyond Temporal workflow state. Owns scheduling/selection + reservation lock. |
| **NPS** (Network Provisioning Service) | GCP | gRPC/Proto wrapper over NetBox (inventory reads + allocation writes); drives Apstra for VRF/VLAN + IPAM. |
| **NetBox** | GCP | Inventory **SoR**. Two writers, non-overlapping fields: Aravolta (physical) + CPS/NPS (allocation). |
| **Aravolta** | GCP | Physical DC infra management; feeds host/switch/router facts into NetBox. |
| **Juniper Apstra** | GCP | Underlay fabric controller; configures site switches over the VPN. |
| **Rafay Controller** | GCP (separate GKE cluster) | Bare-metal OS + K8s lifecycle + addons. **CPS↔Rafay = REST.** |
| **Rafay Head Node** | Site | Last-mile agent: IPMI discovery, PXE boot, host config. |
| **Site servers** | Site | CPU servers (control plane) + GPU servers (workers). |

**Networks at site:** PXE/provisioning rides a **separate OOB VLAN**, distinct from
the tenant data network/VRF.

**Trust boundaries:** our services (TMS/CPS/NPS/NetBox/Apstra) are all cloud-side,
one trust domain. The only VPN crossings are vendor-internal: Apstra→switches and
Rafay Controller↔Rafay Head Node (head node dials out).

## Provisioning workflow (Temporal saga)

Async: `ProvisionCluster` starts the workflow and returns an operation handle;
TMS polls `GetOperation`/`GetCluster`. Each mutating step has a compensating
action; activities are idempotent (Temporal retries them).

> `python3 gen/build_provision_flow.py`.

**Failure handling (D2):** when an activity exhausts retries, the workflow
transitions to `AWAITING_REVIEW` and waits on a human signal — **resume**
(retry/continue) or **cancel** (run compensations in reverse, free resources). No
automatic rollback. GPU nodes are expensive; default is to hold, not auto-release.

## Decisions

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| D1 | **Start small, no reservation concurrency.** A **CPS-held lock** serializes reservation requests to NPS: acquire to reserve, release after; lock has auto-expiry; callers wait if it's held. |
| D2 | **On failure: pause → human review → resume or rollback.** Temporal workflow waits on a signal; cancel runs compensations to free resources. Not auto-rollback. |
| D3 | **NetBox is the allocation SoR.** Aravolta (physical facts) and CPS/NPS (allocation facts) write **non-overlapping fields** on a NetBox object. |
| D4 | **NetBox→Rafay inventory sync is a separate periodic CPS workflow** (every few hours) — the second use case, not part of the provision path. |
| D5 | **Preflight check** on reserved nodes (health/reachability) before committing them to the tenant. |
| D6 | **PXE on a separate OOB VLAN**, distinct from the tenant data network/VRF. |
| D7 | **CPS is stateless** (only Temporal workflow state). TMS/PGSQL owns tenant→cluster→assets for billing. |
| D8 | **Scheduling/selection logic lives in CPS** (GPU type/count match, RDMA rail/leaf locality, control-plane anti-affinity). |
| D9 | **Idempotency key** on `ProvisionCluster` so TMS retries don't start a duplicate workflow. |
| D10 | **CPS↔Rafay over REST** (cross-cluster, vendor product). TMS↔CPS↔NPS over gRPC/Proto in-cloud. VPN crossings are vendor-internal (Apstra→switches, Rafay Ctrl↔Head). Rafay REST creds from a secrets manager; Rafay project/RBAC mapped 1:1 to tenants. |
| D11 | **AiFabrik management/monitoring workload** deployed via a **Rafay addon/blueprint** (declarative, re-applied). |

## Follow-ups

- **F1 — Kubeconfig delivery.** No Rafay ZTKA. Direct API-server kubeconfig — needs
  (a) network reachability from cloud/tenant to the API server in the tenant VRF at
  site, and (b) credential lifecycle (issue/rotate/revoke). Design after cluster
  build is settled.
- **F2 — Storage (Weka).** Filesystem + CSI integration; deferred.
- **F3 — Concurrency-safe reservation.** Replace the single CPS lock with an atomic
  compare-and-set reserve in NPS when we scale past serialized requests.
